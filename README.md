#### What is Bizzee? 


##### Bizzee is an app that gamifies a personal to-do list, providing more fun by randomly assigning a task from a pre-entered to do list, for the person who feels un-motivated or simply wants to spice up their chores. The user is incentavized with a reward system (medals & tracker) when a task is completed. Completed tasks and scores are recorded in the dashboard, where the user can see hard data for her successes.


#### What is the user-experience like?

##### When the user arrives on the landing page they will be prompted to log-in. The user will be taken to the home page where they click assigned a task to complete. The accepted task goes to a pending scoreboard in the 'dashboard' or profile page.
